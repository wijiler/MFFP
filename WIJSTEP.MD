# I have no fucking clue how STEP fully works, I do not have acces to the file spec BUT, from my heavy analysis this is how it works

first read the wikipedia

then now you have no fucking clue what the data section commands are but I can kinda make them out

They generate common NURBS structures, then VERTEX_POINT converts that to a point in vertex space  
Use [steptools](https://www.steptools.com/stds/stp_aim/html/schema.html#step_merged_ap_schema) to reference for commands


note: dont read this, this is for my personal use.
